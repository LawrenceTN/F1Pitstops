# F1PitstopsProject
The F1 pitstop is a project I created to show basic skills of Microsoft Excel and MySQL that presents pitstop data from the 2021 F1 season to the 2022 F1 season.

Formula 1 (F1) is the world's most prestigious motor racing competition that consists of 20 drivers and 10 teams. 
Each team has 2 drivers and a large team of engineers and mechanics that help modify the car to ensure that it not only is extremely fast, but also is capable of enduring the thousands of miles each car accumulates through the 20+ race season.
This makes F1 much more intriguing to me, as it isn't solely about the 20 drivers competing on the track.

Each season, the FIA, the governing body F1, alters the rules and constrains of each car to enforce each team to build a new car each season. One of the rules changed from the 2021 to 2022 season was the tire regulation change.
Each time had to move on from a 13-inch tire to a much larger 18-inch tire. With this massive change, I was interested to see how this would affect each team's pitstop crew's performance regarding their time. With a 38% increase in size, I hypothesized that each team would see an increase in time in their pitstops.

This is a basic project to showcase my data analysis skills in a subject I'm interested in. I would love to hear any advice / requests from viewers if they have any questions or tips on how to improve.
