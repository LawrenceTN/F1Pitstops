# F1PitstopsProject
The F1 pitstop is a project I created to show basic skills of Microsoft Excel and MySQL that presents pitstop data from the 2021 F1 season to the 2022 F1 season.

Formula 1 (F1) is the world's most prestigious motor racing competition that consists of 20 drivers and 10 teams. 
Each team has 2 drivers and a large team of engineers and mechanics that help modify the car to ensure that it not only is extremely fast, but also is capable of enduring the thousands of miles each car accumulates through the 20+ race season.
This makes F1 much more intriguing to me, as it isn't solely about the 20 drivers competing on the track.

Between each season, the FIA, the governing body of F1, alters the rules and the constraints of the competition that forces each team to build a new car each season. One of the highlighted changes that were implemented this year was the 18-inch tire regulation. In the 2021 season, the regulation size of the tire was 13-inches. With this massive change, I was interested to see how this would affect each team's pitstop crew's performance regarding their time. With a 38% increase in size, I hypothesized that each team would see an increase in time in their pitstops as they adjust to the larger-sized tire.

Data was acquired from inmotion.DHL. DHL is a long-standing global partner of Formula 1. Initially, I wanted to use Python to showcase my data scraping skills but was restricted from doing so because it required an API key. I had to then resort to manually copying the data onto an excel sheet and then transferring it over to MySQL for analysis. From MySQL, I extracted the data I needed and used Tableau Public to showcase the data graphically.

This is a basic project to showcase my data analysis skills in a subject I'm interested in. I would love to hear any advice/requests from viewers if they have any questions or tips on how to improve.

**UPDATE 11/7/2022**

No longer using the point system for each driver as I wanted the focus to be on the data rather than a 'competition'. May change my mind later. 
Updated with the race data for the US Grand Prix in Austin and the Mexico Grand Prix in Mexico City.
